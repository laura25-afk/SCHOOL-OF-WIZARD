&lt;p&gt;By an &lt;strong&gt;Active Learning Methodology&lt;/strong&gt; that makes you active in your learning process during classroom activities. These strategies promote a change of focus in the teaching-learning process. Therefore, we refer to it as a student-centred methodology. Active learning techniques include role-playing, group projects, think-pair-share, peer teaching, debates,  class discussion, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Your teacher&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;informant and resource, providing suitable input (dialogues, narratives, descriptions, word meanings, etc.);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;assessor and monitor of meaningful learning experiences;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;diagnoser of interests and needs;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;motivator, prompter and generator of positive attitudes;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;provider, organiser, controller and participant of second language acquisition situation&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to know important information, go to the following titles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="exe-fx exe-carousel"&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1st Mission&lt;/strong&gt;: designing a digital map with information to guarantee safety.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3rd Mission: &lt;/strong&gt;creating a  digital poster as magical animal guide to show how to take care of them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4th Mission&lt;/strong&gt;: making a potion to meet the 2030 Agenda.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The final challenge: &lt;/strong&gt;creating an digital scrapbook with information to help other new students.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
